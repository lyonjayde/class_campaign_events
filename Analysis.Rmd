```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(plotly)

# some varying data for R - .rds , .Rdata , .rda : but rds is the best

events <- readRDS("events_saved.rds")


```

## Intro

```{r}

# Two things to look for 

events %>% 
  group_by(cand_lastname) %>% 
  count(cand_lastname) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

events <- events %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date))

events %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  count(month) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
